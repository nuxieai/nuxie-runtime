# Parity Closeout Status

Live state for `docs/parity-closeout-map.md`. The next session must be able
to resume from this file alone. Keep it small: archive completed-ticket
logs the way `v2-status.md` / `renderer-status.md` did.

## Scorecard (update per session; `make parity-scorecard` once #B-4 lands)

| tier | state | number | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Frame parity | PARTIAL | exact-segments 647/647; scripted 647/647; e2e-exact: gate not built | floor green; #OR-6 missing |
| 2 Interaction parity | RED | side-channel: gate not built; fuzz-clean-nights: 0 | #OR-1/2/3/7 |
| 3 SDK parity | RED | A-rows closed 0/8 | register A-table |
| 4 Platform parity | PARTIAL | pixel-exact 1468/1468; adapters 1/2 | static floor now fails closed across the known M5 Max / Paravirtual clippedcubic2 oracle split; full adapter matrix remains #HD-2 |
| 5 Performance & size | RED | ratio 0.897–0.914 (non-blocking, 6 files); size 7.19 MiB OFF / 7.95 MiB ON, budget pending | #OR-9, #B-3 USER-GATE |

Regression floor (must stay green): `make golden-compare` 317/647 ·
`make scripted-golden-compare` · `make renderer-golden` 1468 ·
`cargo test --workspace` · `make capi-smoke`.

Upstream pins: runtime `d788e8ec` (cycle-3 cut `b73bc675`, 3 commits ahead,
awaiting #B-1 approval). Upstream advanced after that completed inventory to
`ba2b6434`; it is next-cycle drift, not part of the pending authorization.
Renderer pixel-oracle `7c778d13` (historical, do not advance casually — see
upstream-sync-map registry).

## Next queue (top = next; orchestrator maintains)

1. #B-1 USER-GATE — approve named S3 rows or defer; no port or pin movement
   before the response.
2. #B-3 USER-GATE — choose the renderer-on size budget and whether it blocks
   on scripting OFF only or both variants.
3. #OR-1 — side-channel spec + C++ emit (spine; next executable work after
   the two submitted gates are answered).
4. #FT-TEXT — remains blocked on the approved/completed #B-1 TextInput port.

## Pending USER-GATEs

- **#B-1 Phase S cycle 3:** report
  `docs/sync/triage-2026-07-20-b73bc675.md` recommends approving S3-1
  (`1b4df2ad`, TextInput) and S3-3 (`b73bc675`, static library linking),
  deferring S3-2 (`079305d7`, profiler) as WATCH, and retaining both existing
  dependency WATCH rows at staleness 2. No active pin has moved.
- **#B-3 size budget:** exact renderer-on link closures are 7,534,056 B
  (7.19 MiB) scripting OFF and 8,335,288 B (7.95 MiB) scripting ON. Choose
  the blocking budget and whether it covers OFF only or both variants.

## Decisions log

- 2026-07-20: Project created from `docs/parity-gap-register.md` (six-way
  evidence sweep). Method/threading/routing inherited from
  `.claude/commands/goal.md` culture; session protocol at
  `.claude/commands/parity.md`.
- 2026-07-20: Cycle-3 approval cut remains fixed at `b73bc675`; post-inventory
  upstream `ba2b6434` is explicitly deferred to the next inventory rather than
  silently widening the pending authorization.
- 2026-07-20: The historical 2.75 MiB size budget is not reused: it measured a
  pre-renderer artifact. #B-3 remains open until the user chooses a new metric
  and budget.

## Log

- 2026-07-20 — #B-1 triage submitted for all 3 commits at `b73bc675`; pinned
  and candidate runtime ratchets localized exactly, and the session stopped
  before porting or pin movement.
- 2026-07-20 — Floor repair restored 317/647 default and scripted runtime
  exactness, migrated three stale atomic/tape renderer oracles without changing
  their contracts, and bound the adapter-dependent clippedcubic2 strict oracle
  to exact M5 Max / Apple Paravirtual references from the same historical `7c`
  revision, with provenance and a fail-closed revision-consistency check. The
  tape row's d788 static reference has a distinct path from the immutable 7c
  strict-atlas reference, so either capture workflow cannot overwrite the
  other's evidence.
- 2026-07-20 — Closeout hardening made the renderer negative control fail
  every active row: exact 0 / diverges 1,468. Ten 6×5 enum rows whose former
  32-pixel budget accepted every possible image tightened from 2/32 to 0/0;
  the real Rust/reference pairs remain byte-exact.
- 2026-07-20 — #B-2 landed the 447-row fail-closed port manifest; exact-b73
  verification reports 378 ported, 21 partial, 43 absent, and 5 N/A.
- 2026-07-20 — #B-3 remeasured the complete 42-root Darwin renderer surface
  twice with byte-identical artifacts: 7.19 MiB OFF, 7.95 MiB ON; independent
  source/root/symbol/hash audit clean; budget USER-GATE pending.
- 2026-07-20 — #B-4 landed the five-tier scorecard and bound each evidence file
  to its canonical command; unbuilt gates remain explicit rather than green.
- 2026-07-20 — #B-1 pin/candidate probing exposed stale golden-runner objects
  across `RIVE_RUNTIME_DIR` changes. The runner now rebuilds both translation
  units for every invocation, preventing upstream-header/library ABI mixing.
- 2026-07-20 — Adapter-selected static renderer references now participate in
  the same physical-alias and stream/frame/mode identity checks as primary
  references; adapter-bound stub oracles must be members of the approved set.
