# Phase R Status

The execution contract is `docs/renderer-port-map.md`. This file records only
current evidence, open gates, and decisions needed by the next session.

## Metric

Run `make renderer-golden`.

- Rust wgpu: exact=5, diverges=0, gated=1,460, total=1,465.
- Stub baseline: exact=0 for every active entry.
- Exact: `first-light-rectangle-msaa`, `gm-rect-msaa`, and
  `artboardclipping-frame-0-msaa`, plus
  `first-light-triangle-clockwise-atomic` and `gm-rect-clockwise-atomic`.

## Milestones

- [x] R0: Pixel golden harness. Parser/replay, PNG comparator, artifacts,
  manifest ratchet, checked-in references, stub baseline, and CI are landed.
  The oracle contains 108 upstream GM streams, 294 valid `.riv` streams, 731
  native Metal references, and 1,465 clockwise-atomic/MSAA entries. The
  pre-existing `solar-system` import error and 33 direct RenderContext/ORE GM
  source files have named gates.
- [x] R1: wgpu foundation and first light. Device/queue/offscreen readback,
  retained render-api objects, state stack, generated WGSL validation, 4x MSAA
  bootstrap coverage, one GM stream, and one real `.riv` stream are exact.
- [ ] R2: Algorithm core.
- [ ] R3: Corpus convergence.
- [ ] R4: Performance parity.
- [ ] R5: Native fast paths and extensions; demand-gated after R4.

## Next

1. Port `gpu.cpp` data contracts and `draw.cpp` path processing. The first
   convergence target is analytic edge coverage for the triangle fixture.
2. Promote the upstream `rect` GM first; it exercises state, transforms,
   overlapping fills, and alpha blending without curves or clips.
3. Expand corpus entries as features become replayable. Do not tune broad
   tolerances around missing algorithm work.

4. Bun-lesson hardening additions (user decision 2026-07-11; details in
   the map): mid-R2 adversarial review of the invented wgpu
   resource/binding plumbing (the ORE-replacement seam — where V2's
   audits proved bugs live); R3 entry criteria: GPU semantic-trap audit
   (GLSL->WGSL/naga divergence surface) and a renderer fuzz-replay
   harness (degenerate streams through both renderers; no panic/hang/
   device-loss; behavioral deltas as named findings).

## Decisions

- 2026-07-10: Phase R activated by the user; incremental R0-R5 strategy chosen.
- 2026-07-10: Pixel space is canonical top-left RGBA8. The C++ Metal bridge
  readback is vertically flipped during replay; the Rust renderer is not
  distorted to match backend-native texture coordinates.
- 2026-07-10: `nuxie-render-stream` is the renderer isolation boundary. Runtime
  and GM capture both produce the same typed stream; C++ FFI and Rust wgpu
  replay consume it independently.

## Log

- 2026-07-10: Repaired the release-rename regression in
  `nuxie-renderer-ffi/build.rs`; native Metal replay builds again.
- 2026-07-10: Landed typed stream parsing/replay, encoded image payloads, pixel
  comparison with side-by-side heatmaps, `corpus-r.toml`, stub-failure ratchet,
  and Phase R CI.
- 2026-07-10: Landed `nuxie-renderer` on wgpu 30 with retained paths/paints,
  state capture, solid polygon rendering, 4x MSAA resolve, and readback. First
  GM and `.riv` fixtures are pixel-exact against C++ Metal.
- 2026-07-11: Completed R0 corpus capture: 108 renderer-interface GMs and 294
  valid `.riv` files produced 731 references and 1,465 mode entries. One known
  invalid `.riv` and 33 direct-context/ORE GM source files remain named-gated.
- 2026-07-11: Began R2 with a reproducible upstream shader pipeline. All 50
  generated WebGPU WGSL modules validate through naga. Ported the `gpu.hpp`
  host upload records, enum encodings, packed tessellation fields, color
  swizzles, and blend IDs with C++ ABI size/offset tests.
- 2026-07-11: Ported the first `draw.cpp` path-preparation slice: transformed
  verb iteration, line/quad/cubic normalization, Wang parametric segment
  counts, closed-contour normalization, and concave triangulation. The MSAA
  bootstrap now uses stencil-then-cover for non-zero and even-odd compound
  fills. The `oval` probe's topology is correct; its remaining 3,136-pixel,
  max-delta-73 difference is confined to flattened cubic edge coverage, so it
  stays gated pending analytic patches.
- 2026-07-11: Ported `gpu.cpp`'s immutable analytic patch-buffer generator,
  including mirrored border diagonals and middle-out fan indices. Its 269
  vertices and 441 indices are invariant-tested and now uploaded once per wgpu
  context for the forthcoming tessellation/draw passes.
- 2026-07-11: Instantiated and executed the upstream `tessellate.glsl` WebGPU
  pipeline through wgpu. A submitted smoke test binds real flush/path/contour
  storage and a `TessVertexSpan`, renders through the canonical 12-index span
  topology, and completes against an `rgba32uint` tessellation target.
- 2026-07-11: Ported fill tessellation layout from `LogicalFlush`: local
  line/quad/cubic normalization, device-space Wang counts, contour records,
  the leading invalid eight-vertex range, and per-path eight-vertex padding.
  The first-light triangle lays out one midpoint-fan patch at base instance 1.
- 2026-07-11: Wired the generated `draw_msaa_path` shaders to the tessellation
  texture and immutable patch buffers. Corrected WebGPU viewport orientation,
  one-polar-endpoint fill counts, per-contour pre-padding, and absolute contour
  starts against C++ source. The first-light triangle now reproduces the known
  MSAA-vs-atomic edge delta exactly (112 pixels, max delta 43); the active
  corpus remains exact=3/diverges=0. Compound fills stay on the prior correct
  stencil fallback until the upstream MSAA stencil/cover pass lands.
- 2026-07-11: Wired the generated clockwise-atomic path/resolve shaders with
  tiled storage buffers and the C++ clear/path ID convention. Threaded render
  mode through `corpus-r` and `renderer-replay` so MSAA and atomic entries no
  longer execute the same backend mode. The atomic triangle passes at 30
  differing edge pixels within its 32-pixel cross-backend budget, moving the
  metric to exact=4 with no divergence.
- 2026-07-11: Threaded clockwise-atomic across ordered solid-fill draws by
  clearing once and resolving each fresh tiled coverage allocation with
  premultiplied SrcOver. The four overlapping translucent draws in `gm:rect`
  pass at 4 differing pixels within budget, moving the metric to exact=5.
