# Phase R Status

The execution contract is `docs/renderer-port-map.md`. This file records only
current evidence, open gates, and decisions needed by the next session.

## Metric

Run `make renderer-golden`.

- Rust wgpu: exact=3, diverges=0, gated=1,462, total=1,465.
- Stub baseline: exact=0 for every active entry.
- Exact: `first-light-rectangle-msaa`, `gm-rect-msaa`, and
  `artboardclipping-frame-0-msaa`.
- Gated: `first-light-triangle-clockwise-atomic`; the geometry and interior
  pixels match, but C++ analytic edge coverage emits thirds while bootstrap
  4x MSAA emits quarters on 112 edge pixels.

## Milestones

- [x] R0: Pixel golden harness. Parser/replay, PNG comparator, artifacts,
  manifest ratchet, checked-in references, stub baseline, and CI are landed.
  The oracle contains 108 upstream GM streams, 294 valid `.riv` streams, 731
  native Metal references, and 1,465 clockwise-atomic/MSAA entries. The
  pre-existing `solar-system` import error and 33 direct RenderContext/ORE GM
  source files have named gates.
- [x] R1: wgpu foundation and first light. Device/queue/offscreen readback,
  retained render-api objects, state stack, generated WGSL validation, 4x MSAA
  bootstrap coverage, one GM stream, and one real `.riv` stream are exact.
- [ ] R2: Algorithm core.
- [ ] R3: Corpus convergence.
- [ ] R4: Performance parity.
- [ ] R5: Native fast paths and extensions; demand-gated after R4.

## Next

1. Port `gpu.cpp` data contracts and `draw.cpp` path processing. The first
   convergence target is analytic edge coverage for the triangle fixture.
2. Promote the upstream `rect` GM first; it exercises state, transforms,
   overlapping fills, and alpha blending without curves or clips.
3. Expand corpus entries as features become replayable. Do not tune broad
   tolerances around missing algorithm work.

## Decisions

- 2026-07-10: Phase R activated by the user; incremental R0-R5 strategy chosen.
- 2026-07-10: Pixel space is canonical top-left RGBA8. The C++ Metal bridge
  readback is vertically flipped during replay; the Rust renderer is not
  distorted to match backend-native texture coordinates.
- 2026-07-10: `nuxie-render-stream` is the renderer isolation boundary. Runtime
  and GM capture both produce the same typed stream; C++ FFI and Rust wgpu
  replay consume it independently.

## Log

- 2026-07-10: Repaired the release-rename regression in
  `nuxie-renderer-ffi/build.rs`; native Metal replay builds again.
- 2026-07-10: Landed typed stream parsing/replay, encoded image payloads, pixel
  comparison with side-by-side heatmaps, `corpus-r.toml`, stub-failure ratchet,
  and Phase R CI.
- 2026-07-10: Landed `nuxie-renderer` on wgpu 30 with retained paths/paints,
  state capture, solid polygon rendering, 4x MSAA resolve, and readback. First
  GM and `.riv` fixtures are pixel-exact against C++ Metal.
- 2026-07-11: Completed R0 corpus capture: 108 renderer-interface GMs and 294
  valid `.riv` files produced 731 references and 1,465 mode entries. One known
  invalid `.riv` and 33 direct-context/ORE GM source files remain named-gated.
