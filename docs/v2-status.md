# V2 Status

Working state for `/goal` sessions. Keep this file small and current; it is
the only memory the next session has. Update it every commit.

## Metric

- Corpus files `exact`: 1
- Current milestone: **M1 — Static Vector Rendering Exact (#V2-2)**

## Milestones

- [x] M0: Golden diff harness + corpus manifest + one exact file
- [ ] M1: Static vector corpus files exact at advance(0); FFI viewer demo
- [ ] M2: Animated playback exact at sampled times; real object model landed; lib.rs modularized
- [ ] M3: Interactive files exact under scripted pointer input
- [ ] M4: Nested artboards/lists exact
- [ ] M5: Data binding exact incl. external view-model mutation
- [ ] M6: Layout + text exact; audio/scripting gated with diagnostics
- [ ] M7: Public `rive` API + C ABI; perf within target of C++

## Next

1. Pick the next simplest static no-animation corpus file and drive it from
   `not-yet` to `exact` through the renderer-trait path.
2. Extend the runtime renderer path for the first missing static vector feature
   exposed by that file.

## Backlog (unsupported features awaiting corpus demand)

- Golden runner view-model mutation scripts; `--view-model-script` is reserved
  but rejected until M5 external data-binding corpus files require it.
- Rust golden runner currently supports static sample `0`, artboard
  clip/background, solid fills/strokes, and no state machines, gradients,
  images, text, nested artboards, or scripted input.
- Corpus entries tagged `cpp-runner-crash` are unsupported until the C++
  golden runner/importer can survive the FileAssetContents, scripting, and
  data-viz crash paths it currently aborts on.
- `solar-system.riv` is unsupported because Rust import rejects
  `blendModeValue = 5` on Shape object 13.

## Decisions

- 2026-07-02: V2 map adopted (`docs/porting-map-v2.md`); V1 map superseded, its contract suite frozen as regression floor.
- 2026-07-02: Golden runner records decoded image payloads by size/hash for the first renderer slice; real decoded dimensions are deferred until `rive_decoders` is wired into the CLI harness build.
- 2026-07-02: Golden runner emits one accumulated stream per run with
  `source`, `input`, `sample`, and `frame` markers; `golden-compare` will split
  sample segments from that stream.
- 2026-07-02: `rive-render-api` owns the renderer seam; `rive-runtime` should
  drive those traits when static drawing moves from reports to real rendering.
- 2026-07-02: `golden-compare` validates the C++ stream for `not-yet` entries
  and refuses `exact` entries unless a Rust runner is supplied, keeping the
  exact count honest while the Rust draw path is still absent.
- 2026-07-02: First exact file is `dependency_test.riv`; the Rust runner
  preallocates source + instance render paints to mirror C++ import/clone
  paint lifetimes before drawing.
- 2026-07-02: `tools/golden-compare --bin generate-corpus` generates the
  corpus manifest from the C++ unit-test assets, preserving exact/unsupported
  annotations across regenerations.
- 2026-07-02: CI pins the reference C++ runtime to
  `7c778d13c5d903b3b74eec1dd6bb68a811dea5f2` and builds root
  `premake5_v2.lua` debug libraries before running `make golden-compare`.
- 2026-07-02: `rive-runtime` owns static draw emission through
  `rive-render-api`; `rust-golden-runner` now only orchestrates import,
  artboard selection, stream markers, and recording output.

## Log

- 2026-07-02: V2 plan, `/goal` command, and this status file created. No V2 code yet.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Added `tools/golden-runner` RecordingRenderer/Factory scaffold, smoke binary, and `make golden-runner`; `make golden-compare` still not present.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Golden runner CLI now imports real `.riv` files, selects
  artboards/state machines, advances sampled timelines, replays pointer input
  scripts, and emits recording streams; `make golden-compare` still not
  present.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Added `crates/rive-render-api` with C++-mirroring
  renderer/factory/resource traits and a recording serializer whose smoke
  output matches the C++ golden runner stream; `make golden-compare` still not
  present.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Added `corpus.toml` with 8 seeded C++ unit-test assets,
  `tools/golden-compare`, and `make golden-compare`; exact count is now 0.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Added `tools/rust-golden-runner` for a narrow static
  solid-shape path and marked `dependency_test` exact; exact count is now 1.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Expanded `corpus.toml` to all 295
  `tests/unit_tests/assets`; `make golden-compare` passes with exact=1,
  unsupported-feature=37, not-yet=257.
- 2026-07-02: [M0] Added GitHub Actions CI for `make golden-compare` and
  `cargo test --workspace`; M0 is complete and the active milestone moves to
  M1.
- 2026-07-02: [M1] Moved the narrow static solid-shape renderer path from
  `rust-golden-runner` into `rive-runtime`; exact remains 1 and
  `make golden-compare` passes.
