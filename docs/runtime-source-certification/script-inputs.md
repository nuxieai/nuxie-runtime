# Script-input source certification

Pinned upstream: `4ac7b32798da0482e441ef09304dc3b480ed3ee5`

Implementing auditor: root campaign lane

Adversarial review: **rejected at the current pin**

This receipt deliberately includes executable methods defined inline in the
handwritten `include/rive/script_input_*.hpp` headers. Those methods exposed
the initial `.cpp`-only denominator as incomplete; they are part of the source
contract even though the first generated census did not count them.

## Common scalar ownership

The Boolean, Color, Number, String, and Trigger implementations share the
same three lifecycle translations:

- binary import status and the ordered scripted-object input catalogue replace
  `ScriptedObjectImporter::addInput` plus the conditional component `Super`
  import;
- `RuntimeScriptInputProperties::clone_for_scripted_object` and
  `RuntimeScriptedListenerInputBindingOccurrence::from_definition` retain one
  clone-owned Core value/DataBind/converter occurrence in authored order;
- Rust collection ownership drops the occurrence and its bind atomically,
  replacing the concrete destructor's `removeProperty` pointer unlink.

The ownership representation is adapted to Rust, but the imported/dropped
status, list order, occurrence isolation, and disposal boundary are exact.
`runtime_import_status_tracks_scripted_object_input_contexts`, the binary
`cpp_import` scripted-object comparison, and
`typed_script_inputs_apply_live_cpp_core_values_and_keep_occurrences_isolated`
cover those shared paths.

The signed C++ color value and Rust `u32` retain identical bits at the script
boundary.

## `src/script_input_number.cpp` and `include/rive/script_input_number.hpp`

| C++ symbol | Rust owner | disposition | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScriptInputNumber::~ScriptInputNumber` | owning occurrence drop | adapted | occurrence replacement/disposal tests |

| `ScriptInputNumber::propertyValueChanged` | `RuntimeScriptInputProperties::apply_target`; `apply_scripted_input_update` | exact | live f32 projection and occurrence-isolation tests |

Rust retains the Core `float` before projecting it to the scripting backend's
number type; the SymbolListIndex-to-f32 precision boundary is tested directly.

## `src/script_input_string.cpp` and `include/rive/script_input_string.hpp`

| C++ symbol | Rust owner | disposition | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScriptInputString::~ScriptInputString` | owning occurrence drop | adapted | occurrence replacement/disposal tests |

| C++ symbol | Rust owner | disposition | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScriptInputTrigger::~ScriptInputTrigger` | owning occurrence drop | adapted | occurrence replacement/disposal tests |
| `ScriptInputTrigger::import` | binary scripted-object import stack; runtime definition builders | exact | import-status and C++/Rust import comparison |

| `ScriptInputTrigger::propertyValueChanged` | `runtime_scripted_listener_bound_value`; `apply_scripted_input_update` | exact | `scripted_input_scalar_trigger_and_artboard_projection_failures_match_cpp`; repeated live trigger test |

Trigger has no initial `initScriptedValue` projection. Zero remains a no-op;
every nonzero changed Core value invokes the named table callback.

## `src/script_input_artboard.cpp` and `include/rive/script_input_artboard.hpp`

| C++ symbol | Rust owner | disposition | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScriptInputArtboard::~ScriptInputArtboard` | owning occurrence drop; `RuntimeScriptInputArtboardOccurrence` drop | adapted | occurrence replacement/disposal tests |

| `ScriptInputArtboard::validateForScriptInit` (inline) | resolved-reference preflight | exact | typed-artboard validation failure tests |
| `ScriptInputArtboard::validateForColdScriptInit` | cold phase accepts the unresolved live context | exact | cold/live hydration lifecycle tests |
| `ScriptInputArtboard::validateHydrationPrerequisites` | snapshot/reference preflight before any writes | exact | `scripted_hydration_validation_failure_applies_no_inputs_or_init` |
| `ScriptInputArtboard::hydrateScriptInput` | authored phase-two artboard resolution and projection | exact | authored artboard hydration tests |

| `ScriptInputArtboard::updateArtboard` | `RuntimeScriptInputProperties::apply_artboard_source`; `RuntimeScriptInputArtboardOccurrence::apply_artboard_source` | **incomplete** | current tests exercise file indices, failed lookup, and repeated ids, not a live `ViewModelInstanceArtboard::asset` or the ancestor rejection |
| `ScriptInputArtboard::referencedArtboardId` | generated value in `RuntimeScriptInputProperties::value`; binary `cpp_artboard_referencer_index` | exact | import resolver and generated-id tests |

The generated `artboardId` and retained referenced Artboard remain separate.
A generated-field write clears an unresolved retained pointer when File
authority exists; a ViewModel update preserves the old pointer on failed
lookup and does not rewrite the generated id.

The generated-id/pointer distinction also corrects the implementing receipt's
original owner mapping: pinned `referencedArtboardId()` returns `artboardId()`,
not the retained reference's id.

## `src/script_input_viewmodel_property.cpp`

| C++ symbol | Rust owner | disposition | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ScriptInputViewModelProperty::~ScriptInputViewModelProperty` | owning occurrence/path drop | adapted | occurrence replacement/disposal tests |

| `ScriptInputViewModelProperty::validateForColdScriptInit` | cold acceptance with cleared occurrence resolution | exact | cold/live retry lifecycle tests |
| `ScriptInputViewModelProperty::validateHydrationPrerequisites` | `bound_script_view_model_property_from_owned_path`; whole-batch preflight | exact | no-partial-write validation test |

| `ScriptInputViewModelProperty::import` | DataBindPath + scripted-object importer state; runtime definition builders | exact | binary import/path tests |
| `ScriptInputViewModelProperty::onAddedClean` | ordered input/binding-definition construction | exact | imported input order/count comparison |

A valid ViewModel-valued property whose current child pointer is null still
passes preflight, performs no table write, continues to later inputs, and may
run user `init`. The path and its resolved-name buffer are independently
cloned for every scripted-object occurrence.

## Adversarial findings

The header-aware denominator is correct. The seven `.cpp` files contain 42
out-of-line definitions. The handwritten headers add exactly 11 executable
bodies: `validateForScriptInit` and `file` for Artboard; `initScriptedValue`
and `validateForScriptInit` for each of Boolean, Color, Number, and String; and
`validateForScriptInit` for Trigger. No additional handwritten inline body was
omitted.

The Artboard input is nevertheless not source-exact. Pinned
`ArtboardReferencer::findArtboard`, called by
`ScriptInputArtboard::updateArtboard`, first accepts a live
`ViewModelInstanceArtboard::asset()->artboard()` and rejects that Artboard when
it is an ancestor of the scripted component's parent Artboard. Only when no
live asset exists does it resolve `propertyValue()` through the File. Current
Rust listener-input binding collapses the source to
`RuntimeDataBindGraphValue::Artboard(u64)` and
`RuntimeScriptInputArtboardOccurrence::apply_artboard_source` can only test a
File artboard index. It carries neither the live `RuntimeBindableArtboard`
identity nor the parent Artboard needed for the ancestor check. The same
representation means `clone_for_scripted_object` cannot copy an asset-backed
retained Artboard pointer as pinned `ScriptInputArtboard::clone` does. The
cited failed-index and repeated-id tests do not exercise either case.

The nullable ViewModel verdict was checked and is sound. C++ preflight tests
the resolved `ViewModelInstanceValue`'s schema property, while
`setViewModelInput` separately observes a null
`referenceViewModelInstance()` and leaves the table field unchanged. The C++
probe and Rust hydration-order tests exercise that distinction.

Destructor accounting in the implementing result was also wrong: all seven
classes have concrete destructors, not five. Rust collection/drop ownership
is an accepted representation adaptation, and the occurrence-drop test proves
source unregistration, but that changes the arithmetic below.

Focused evidence rerun with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`:

- binary scripted-object import-context test: passed;
- typed live Core values/occurrence isolation, Artboard clone authority,
  ViewModel path deep-clone, hydration-order, scalar/trigger/Artboard callback,
  embedded-NUL Core string, and occurrence-drop tests: passed;
- `script_input_bindings` integration suite: 11 passed;
- Lua C-string boundary test: passed;
- the C++ null-ViewModel probe target compiled and passed its harness, but the
  actual external probe comparison was skipped because
  `RIVE_CPP_PROBE_SCRIPTED` was not configured in this checkout;
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: passed.

None of those tests supplies the missing live asset-backed ScriptInputArtboard
case, which is why green focused evidence does not override the rejection.

## Result

The seven files contribute 42 out-of-line definitions and 11 executable inline
methods. All 53 have identified Rust owners, but identified ownership is not
parity: seven destructor rows use the approved Rust ownership adaptation, 44
rows preserve the supported observable contract, and the two Artboard rows
named above remain incomplete. Certification is rejected until live
asset-backed Artboard input update/clone behavior and ancestor rejection are
represented and differentially exercised.

The historical scalar RB4 gap is stale: scalar Core values,
occurrence-local scalar cloning, converter ownership, callback projection, and
file-index source/target reconciliation are live and directly exercised. That
does not close the retained Artboard-pointer branch described above.
